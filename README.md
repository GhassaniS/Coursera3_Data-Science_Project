# Coursera3_Data-Science_Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Goal of the Project

1. A tidy data set

2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis

3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

4. Include a README.md in the repo with the scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

5. Analysis R Script
